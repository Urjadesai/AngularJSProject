            <li>A pseudo-class is state of something in the DOM. Just like a class is a tag you associate with an element, a pseudo-class is a class that gets associated by the browser or DOM or whatever, usually as a response to a change in state. When a user visits a link -- that link can take on the state of 'visited'.</li>
